    <p >Raghava is a cameraman for the channel Green TV, where his crush Nandini works. He still has a fear of ghosts and lives with his mother. When Green TV drops to the second position in the ratings, Nandini advises shooting a horror program to bring their channel back to the first position. After the board members agree on this plan, Nandini decides on a location, Mahabalipuram, with a house near a beach with an intensely haunted look, without knowing that the house is haunted. She sets out with her crew: Raghava, his watchman Mayil, the boss's family doctor, Dr Prasad, two lighting technicians, Arnold and Aravind Swamy, and the show's anchor, Pooja, to complete the task.

        While shooting on a nearby beach, Nandini discovers a nuptial chain in the sand. After the discovery, mysterious events started taking place. The next day, when the group begins shooting at the house, they see a lunatic in rags running out and become scared. She decides to visit a sorcerer. The priest discovers that the nuptial chain is haunted. He lets Nandini out of his room and returns the chain to the spirit. Nandini does not seem to believe it, and the priest challenges her to check the place where she had taken it. After Nandini and Pooja disturb the nuptial chain for a second time, it beats them up and refuses to leave them. She rushes to the sorcerer and helps her. As instructed by him, she prepares a coffin and a woman's corpse. They dress her like a bride, place Nandini's hair, clothes, and sand inside, and nail it shut. They move to a distance and shoot. They are shocked to see that the coffin splinters open. Subsequently, the dead woman gets dragged by the ghost.</p>

<p>Sameera, a student at RK University, commits suicide after failing her CUET exam despite being a brilliant student. Gurudev Deshmukh, the principal of RK university and Sameera's teacher, is distraught and files a petition against private colleges for depriving public institutions of funds and declining opportunities to bright students who studied in Government Colleges with the support of Samarth Bhagwath, Gurudev's former student and Bangalore DC, and Education Minister Raghav Reddy. Antony Joseph, who runs the private colleges for his benefits, retaliates by sending gangsters across the state to stop the petition, but is warned and thrashed by Arjun, a student leader.

    Arjun gets kicked out for going against the college; he gets himself admitted into RK university as a student only to learn that Antony Joseph has sent goons, disguised as students as they want to ruin the students by disrupting their studies using harassment and drug supply. Vandana, a medical lecturer at the university, suspects Arjun when she witnesses him packing drugs and keeping them in library books. Arjun runs into a mysterious person, who recognizes him and his intentions. Arjun takes the mysterious person's place and meets Antony and his gang, where he finds that Raghava Reddy and the university's Vice Principal Jayapal are in cahoots with Antony Joseph.</p>
